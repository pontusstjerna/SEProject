# SEProject
Software Engineering Project spring 2017

# To run the prototype
java -jar terminal2-program.jar

the system is then available at: localhost:8080/

# Ids that might be useful for testing
valid vessel id: urn:mrn:stm:vessel:IMO:9398917
valid portcall id: urn:mrn:stm:portcdm:port_call:SEGOT:315784aa-4761-44ac-8e42-6fdcdd302600
Other vessel/portcall ids work of course, as long as they exist in the system. You do need one of them to send PortCallMessages

# Valid Berths
skarvik520
skarvik511
all other berths work as well, as long as they exist in the location registry
